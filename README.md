## Overview
This project is a web-based application that enables users to communicate via emails. 
It is built using Flask, HTML, CSS, Jinja templates, and an SQL database.

### Goal
The main goal of this project is to create a secure and efficient email communication platform while exploring advanced technical concepts like database management, hashing, and web development.

---

## Key Features
- **User Registration**: Validates email structure and checks for duplicates before hashing passwords for secure storage.
- **Login System**: Ensures authentication by validating credentials against hashed passwords.
- **Password Reset**: Allows users to reset their password securely using a verification question.
- **Inbox**: Displays received emails, marking them as read or unread based on user actions.
- **Sent Items**: Allows users to review sent emails and their responses.
- **Compose Email**: Enables users to send emails with subject, content, and recipient validation.
- **Email Replies**: Supports replies linked to parent emails using a dedicated "responses" table.
- **Profile Management**: Lets users view and update their profile information.
- **Error Handling**: Catches database conflicts during simultaneous email submissions and prompts users to retry.

## Database Design
![Database Schema Image](#) <!-- Add a link or embed the image here -->

### Schema Reference
Provide a downloadable or viewable link to the complete database schema.

### Explanation
- **Users Table**: Stores user details like name, email, hashed password, and verification question/answer.
- **Message Details Table**: Tracks email content, date, time, and read/unread status.
- **User Messages Table**: Links users to their sent and received emails.
- **Responses Table**: Maps replies to their parent emails.

---

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Simultaneous Email Submissions**: Solved using a unique database index combining content, subject, date, and time, along with `try-except` error handling.
- **Password Security**: Implemented hashing to ensure passwords are never stored in plaintext.
- **Data Integrity**: Used relational tables to maintain consistency between emails and responses.
